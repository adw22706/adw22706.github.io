		<hr>
		<H2 Style = "text-align:center; color:Red;">The History of Swimming.</h2> 		
		<P Style = "Text-align:center;">Since the creation of the modern Summer Olympics, swimming has been a mainstay event. 
		The nataoriums used for the swimming events are usually full for preliminary and Semi-finals, and always full for the Timed-Finals.
		There are 34 total events. Men and women swim all of the same events except for the 800 and 1500 meter free style.
		Men swim the 1500, while women swim the 800. Even after 100 plus years of Olympic swimming there is still and stigma around women swimming long distance races. 
		The 1908 Olympics held in London was the first Olympic Games to hold swimming events in a enclosed pool. Previously the events were held in open bodies of water such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Seine in Paris.</P>

		<H2 Style = "Text-align:center; color:Red;">The Strokes</h2>
		<p Style = "Text-align:center;"  >Swimming has four basic strokes: FreeStyle, Breaststroke, Butterfly, and Backstroke. Races are divided by stroke and gender. 
		Freestyle races range in distance from 50 meters to 1500 meters. The other strokes are from 100 to 200 meters only. 
		The IM races are the only once that combine all four strokes. There are two IM races, the 200 meter and the 400 meter. 
		In the 200 for example; the swimmers swim 50 meters of one stroke before switching strokes coming off a turn at the wall.  
		The swimmers must swim the race in the order of (1st)Butterfly, (2nd) backstroke, (3rd)breaststroke, and (4th) freestyle.

		In September USA Swimming released the 2020 Olympic Trial Qualifying times. Every four years these times continue to drop to keep 
		up with the talent in the United States and around the world.</P>

		<P> In 2008 at the Beijing Olympics the United States was not the favorite to win the Mens 4x100 Freetyle Relay. France was considered the fastest going into 
			the finals. The members of the USA finals relay team in order that they swam: Michael Phelps, Garrett Weber-Gale, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak. 
			Phelps started the relay with a 47.51 (set the American Record) and the US was second going into the first transition. Webber-Gale dove in .27 seconds behind Australia. 
			At the second transition Cullen Jones and the US were in first with France only .43 seconds behind. By the final leg of the relay France pulled ahead by .59 seconds and extended that lead to .82 seconds by the 350 meter mark. 
			Off the 350 wall Jason Lezak was behind, at the 375 he was still an arms length behind France. Within the last 25 meters Lezak caught up and out-touched France at the wall by .08 seconds. This race set the world record and helped establish American dominance at the 
			2008 Olympics in the swimming events. Here is a video of the race: <a href = "https://vimeo.com/7735706"> 2008 Beijing Olympics Swimming Men's 4x100 Freestyle Relay Final</a> 

	
		<H2 Style = "Text-align:center; color:Red;"> My Swimming Career </H2>
		<p Style = "Text-align:center;"> I started swimming when I was 14. When I started swimming I only swam to get in shape, but as time progressed I realized how much I love the
		sport and realized I wanted to compete in meets. By the end of my club swimming days I qualified for four different State Championships and 
		Southeastern Sectionals. I formed lifelong friendships with my teammates and will always miss those days. </P>
